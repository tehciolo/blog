This is not a food blog, so you get the recipe at the top. No need to scroll
down through childhood memories.

## Recipe

Ingredients:

- 1 large Napa (Chinese) cabbage head (900g)
- salt
- 1 bunch green onion
- 3 medium sized carrots (222g)
- 1 small daikon radish (420g)
- 1 large asian pear (250g)
- 6 cloves (20g) garlic, peeled
- 5 cm (82g) piece ginger, peeled
- 60ml fish sauce
- 40g
  [Korean red pepper flakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_chili_pepper#Gochugaru)
- 2 L glass jar

Directions:

1. Take your Napa cabbage and slice in half lengthwise. Cut each of those halves
   and cut in half again, making quarters. Cut each of those quarters into 2.54
   cm wide strips.
2. Take your cabbage and place into a large bowl, heavily seasoning it with
   kosher salt. Squeeze and toss your cabbage really hard, bruising it. Let it
   sit for at least 30 minutes.
3. While the cabbage is sitting, take your green onions and cut the root bottoms
   off. Cut the onion into 2.54 cm segments. Take your carrots and roughly chop
   them julienne style. Next, peel your medium-sized daikon and cut them like
   your carrots, but a thicker julienne chop.
4. To make your paste, slice your 5 cm segment of peeled ginger and place into a
   food processor. Peel and chop an asian pear into cubes and add to the
   processor. Add in 6 cloves of peeled garlic, and 60 ml of fish sauce. Blend
   until smooth.
5. Transfer paste to a medium-sized bowl and mix together with korean red pepper
   flakes.
6. After your cabbage has been sitting, drain through a colander and rinse with
   water while squeezing at the same time. Toss and squeeze until youâ€™ve washed
   off the majority of the salt.
7. Add your cabbage and all of the vegetables you cut into a large bowl. From
   there, add in all of your paste and toss to thoroughly coat. Once evenly
   coated, pack contents into a 2 L glass jar that is large enough to fit the
   mixture. Using a spoon or muddler, press down all of the vegetables so it is
   packed together, removing any air bubbles in there.
8. Loosely cap the jar off, making sure you donâ€™t tighten it all the way down
   (for it to release gas) and let it sit for 4-7 days. Make sure to press it
   throughout this time to remove air bubbles that form.
9. Once your Kimchi has reached the desired flavor point, tighten the cap all
   the way and store it in the refrigerator.

Et voilÃ !

## But why?

[Kimchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi) is a hot topic right now. I'm
hoping to get a lot of visits off of this post.

No, but seriously. I have not found one person so far that tolerates spicy food
and does not love Kimchi. It makes sense. It's **really** good and can be used
in a ton of ways (like [Kimchi fries](https://thewoksoflife.com/kimchi-fries/)
or
[Kimchi Bloody Mary](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/kimchi-bloody-mary)).
It's also fermented, and I think we can all agree that things that are
[funky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omab6QAwBCA) are _way better_ than
things that are not. Last but not least, there's some nice
[research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24456350/) on it.

But Cosmin, why buy it when it's readily available basically "everywhere"? Well,
as a wise man once said, **"Everything tastes better when you make it from
scratch"** ([Joshua Weissman](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/)). Actually, this
recipe is ripped off from said Weissman, and adjusted here and there when it
comes to quantities.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXhJcdXPyYI&t=335s)'s the recipe in video
form, from his official channel if you need a visual aid.

The nice thing about making it yourself is that you understand the process and
can then put your spin on it. Hate carrots? Swap them out for some parnsip.
Don't like cabbage that much? Increase the amount of daikon radish. Maybe even
add some bok choy in there. You do you.

BTW why do you hate carrots? Are you some kind of monster?

## Let's Kim some chi!

First things first. Get everything ready.

![Kimchi ingredients and tools](/kimchi-ingredients.jpg)

You might notice that is no ordinary jar. You are right! Good eye.

It has a nifty way of not letting air in, but letting air out. I don't know what
it's actually called, but my Brazilian friends told me it's a farting jar. I do
not want to verify this by doing any research, as I think the name is very
fitting. I just call it that now. You DO NOT need a farting jar to make Kimchi.
Use a normal jar.

Let's get some prep in! Cabbage first.

![Napa cabbage cut according to directions](/kimchi-cabbage.jpg)

Cut, add salt, bruise, let it sit. Set aside.

Let's tackle the paste next!

![Collage of Kimchi paste ingredients and end result](/kimchi-paste-collage.jpg)

I took some pictures of the chopped up ingredients for the paste, so you can see
the sizes. This is really important because you then throw everything (+ fish
sauce) in a food processor and blend the shit out of it. Pepper flakes should be
folded in after blending.

On to the daikon radish! We want a french fry like cut, but shorter.

![Daikon radish cut similar to french fries](/kimchi-daikon.jpg)

Carrots are next. Do your best to cut them in planks, and then cut slivers of
that.

![Carrots cut into thin elongated rectangles](/kimchi-carrot.jpg)

Let's do green onions. A cut of roughly 2.54 cm would do.
[Metric](https://www.ilovemetric.com/) rules!

![Green onion cut into 2.54 size segments](/kimchi-green-onion.jpg)

Time to rinse the cabbage thoroughly. That means a lot. Squeeze the water out of
it as well. We don't want wattery kimchi. Dump it in a large pot. We need space
to mix everything together.

![Wilted cabbage in pot](/kimchi-cabbage-wilted.jpg)

Add all the veggies to the pot along with the paste. It's time for some magic!

Remember kids: It's always a good idea to wear gloves when any considerable
amount of [capsaicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin) is involved.
Also, you probably don't want your hands to smell of fish sauce.

![Veggies mixed with paste](/kimchi-money-shot.jpg)

Let's bring out the farting jar. Dump mix in and pack everything as tight as you
can. Ideally, solids should be under the liquid. This will be easier to
accomplish as days go by.

![Kimchi in a chinese fermentation jar](/kimchi-jarred.jpg)

Notice the jar is maybe 3 quarters full. This is important because during
fermentation you will get an increase in volume as a result of all the wonderful
mingling happening there. The extra space will come in handy.

Place in a dark warm spot. Ideally you want something above 18Â°C, but below
24Â°C. The hotter it will be, the quicker it will ferment. All in all it should
take anywhere between 4 to 7 days, but you should check starting day 4.

As fermentation happens, air bubbles will form.

![Kimchi in a chinese fermentation jar with air bubbles forming](/kimchi-bubbles.jpg)

You need to smoosh everything once a day to get the air to the surface. Care for
your kimchi, peeps!

Once it's reached your desired funkyness, transfer it to smaller jars and keep
it in the fridge. It will continue to slowly ferment, but I will bet you it
won't last long.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
