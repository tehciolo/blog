Hi. My name is Cosmin CioaclÄƒ and I am a recovering Cascader. Cascadee?
Cascadist! I did unspeakable things with Style Sheets. I used `div`s and `span`s
where other tags were way more appropriate. I religiously used `console.log` so
that I did not have to figure out how the debugger works.

And I slowly got better. However, this was not
[in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). **This blog is my attempt to
change that.**

Since I now have a blog (**bold** statement!), I will probably use it for some
of my other interests as well. As long as it's somewhat learning adjacent, I
will consider it fair game.

P.S.: I posted this now so that you don't believe this is some kind of New
Year's resolution.
